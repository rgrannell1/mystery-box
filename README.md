# Mystery-Box ðŸ“¦

Construct a developer environment in one command.

## Usage:

```bash
box up [--config <str>]
box in [--user <user>]
box stop
```

## Description:

`box up` reads configuration from `box.yaml` in the current directory or a provided configuration file.

```yaml
user: user
memory: 3G
disk: 30G
playbook: '/home/user/.ansible/bootstrap.yaml'
key_folder: '/home/user/.ssh'
# -- optional, but you might want this for private git repositories
copy:
  - src: '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa'
    dest: '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa'
```

it uses Multipass to provision a VM instance, and Ansible to configure instance software. The instance "bootstraps" itself; it has ansible installed, and the provided playbook configures the machine its on. 

Connections into the machine are managed by an SSH-keypair generated by `box`, and a cross-platform Python-based SSH client. This should allow `box` to work on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
