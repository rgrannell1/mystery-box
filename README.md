# Mystery-Box ðŸ“¦

Construct a developer environment in one command.

## Usage:

```bash
box up [--config <str>]
box launch
[--memory <memory>] [--disk <disk>] [--backend <backend>] [--playbook <str>]
box in [--user <user>]
box stop
```

## Description:

`box up` reads configuration from `box.yaml` in the current directory; `box launch` receives similar arguments from cli (since a file-based interface is not always ideal)

```yaml
user: user
ssh_public_path: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
memory: 3G
disk: 30G
playbook: '/home/user/bootstrap.yaml'

```
